 Sushi is a popular Japanese dish that has gained worldwide recognition. It originated in Japan and has a rich history that dates back centuries.
 Today, sushi is enjoyed by people of all cultures and is known for its fresh flavors and unique presentation.

    <p class="para1">
    At its core, sushi (寿司, 鮨) is a delectable combination of vinegared rice, raw or cooked seafood, 
and various ingredients, all expertly wrapped in a sheet of seaweed known as nori. The rice used in sushi is typically seasoned with rice
 vinegar, which gives it a tangy and slightly sweet taste.

        Food is very serious business in Japan.
         Japanese food is prepared carefully using seasonal ingredients and flavors
        Japanese food is as much about the preparation and presentation as it is the food itself. A great deal of thought goes into every item served.
        While we think of only four annual seasons, Japanese chefs consider dozens of seasons .
